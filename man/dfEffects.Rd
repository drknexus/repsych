\title{Degrees of Freedom and Effects}
\usage{
dfEffects(vars, levels)
}
\arguments{
\item{vars}{(character vector) Independent Variables}

\item{levels}{(integer vector) Levels for each of those indpendent variables respectively}
}
\value{
data.frame with two columns, effect (the name of the effect) and df (the df associated with that effect)
}
\description{
Calculate the effects and degrees of freedom 
for a set of \emph{fully crossed} effects.
}
\examples{
#Table 18.24
#Calculate the within effects
within <- dfEffects(c("Expectancy","Pupil Sex"),c(2,2))
#Specify the between effects (these can't be calculated using dfEffects because they aren't fully crossed)
btwn <- data.frame(effect=c("Sex of Teacher","Teachers (within sex)"),df=c(1,8))
#Now we rbind these two and use grid.expand to explore all possible combinations

table.18.24 <- rbind(btwn,within,data.frame(effect=apply(expand.grid(btwn$effect,within$effect),1,paste,collapse=":"),df=apply(expand.grid(btwn$df,within$df),1,prod)))
# Table 18.30 uses the same between subjects effects but has a more complex within structure that we create using this function

within <- dfEffects(c("Expectancy","Pupil Sex","Diagnosis"),c(2,2,2))
rbind(btwn,within,data.frame(effect=apply(expand.grid(btwn$effect,within$effect),1,paste,collapse=":"),df=apply(expand.grid(btwn$df,within$df),1,prod)))
# Note: Obviously the order of effects is different here than in R&R.

\title{Calculate the population standard deviation of x
Usage
popsd(x)}
\usage{
popsd(x, nomiss = 0.8)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A numeric vector}

\item{nomiss}{A numeric vector specifying the proporiton of valid cases in x
(i.e. data that must not be NA) for the sd to be returned}
}
\description{
Calculate the population standard deviation of x
Usage
popsd(x)
}
\note{
R's built-in sd function divides the sum of the squared deviations
from the mean by the number of observations minus 1 (N-1). However,
there are times where one would prefer to use the formula with N
in the denominator (e.g. if one is working with the entire population
of scores). This function does just that.

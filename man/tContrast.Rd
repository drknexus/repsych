\title{Conduct a t-contrast}
\usage{
tContrast(DV, IV, wgt = NULL, alpha = 0.05, EQVAR = FALSE,
  alternative = "greater")

\method{print}{tContrast}(x, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{DV}{A numeric vector of the same length as IV containing the measured values.}

\item{IV}{A factor of the same length as DV containing the independent variable codes.}

\item{wgt}{A numeric vector containing the contrast weights corresponding to each successive level of the IV.  If this value is left NULL, the function will try to use the \code{\link{contrasts}} set on the IV to conduct the test(s)}

\item{alpha}{A numeric element > .00 and < 1.00 specifying the Type I error rate.}

\item{EQVAR}{A logical indicating whether equal variances amongst the groups should be assumed.}

\item{alternative}{A character vector specifying the alternative hypothesis. Must be one of "unequal", "greater", or "less".}

\item{x}{an object used to select the method.}

\item{...}{further arguments passed to or from other methods.}
}
\description{
Returns a t-value based on the given contrast weights
Same as yuen.contrast (see Ryne's code, not implemented in russmisc) only no trimming is allowed.
Created largely for sanity checks, yuen.contrast should generally be used.
}
\section{Details}{

This function computes a t-value for a DV given a set of
contrast weights following Rosenthal, Rosnow, & Rubin (2000). If EQVAR=FALSE
then degrees of freedom are calculated using Welch's method. The wgt option
allows one to specify contrast weights to test hypotheses with more than
2 levels of an IV. By default it tests the hypothesis that the sum of the wgt
vector times the DV means for each IV is greater than 0.
To get a two-tailed p-value or one predicting a negative contrast,
change the \code{alternative} parameter.

\examples{
# To test a single contrast...
tContrast(warpbreaks$breaks,warpbreaks$tension,wgt=c(-1,0,1))
# To test multiple contrasts...
# We make a matrix with our desired contrasts
my.contr <- cbind(
 I = c(-1,0,1),
 II = c(1,0,-1),
 III = c(1,-2,1)
)
# Now we set the contrasts along side the variable
# Now we have to change how.many to match the number
# of contrasts we have 
contrasts(warpbreaks[,"tension"],how.many=3) <- my.contr # set the contrasts for the 'group' factor
tContrast(warpbreaks$breaks,warpbreaks$tension)

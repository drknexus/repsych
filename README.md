repsych
=======

R Function for Reproducible Research in Psychology

## Accessing
Following a Bazaar style of development, repsych will soon be pushed to CRAN (really).  This bleeding edge development version is usually going to be preferable.  You can access this version using the install_github function inside of `devtools` (details below).  If you rely on some 'broken' functionality, you can always grab the source from the right version here (or hold onto it yourself with packrat).

### Official github method
After you complete the steps below you can use the following code to update to the current version:
```
library(devtools)
install_github('repsych','drknexus')
library(repsych)
```
If you want to only temporarily update set dev_mode TRUE first...
```
library(devtools)
dev_mode(TRUE)
install_github('repsych','drknexus')
library(repsych)
#stuff you want to do here
dev_mode(FALSE)
```

#### Mac/Linux Setup
Install the devtools library ```install.packages('devtools')```
#### Windows Setup
* Install Rtools, http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/ to match your version of R
* Install devtools via ```install.packages('devtools',type='source')```.  Using type='source' may result in not needing Rtools (your milage may vary).


## Notice
Not all code is in here is mine.  Not all code in here works.

## Style Guide
Suggestions accepted.
### Function Names
* Functions will be provided in camelCaseLikeThis except where it harms readablity or makes no sense.
* For example km2mi is not benefited by being turned into km2Mi.
* Abreviations are all uppercase unless they start the function name.  For example aicCompare versus compareAIC.
* As a general matter, functions will be defined in verb-noun order as in "I want to <verb> <noun>".
* Nouns for these purposes will remain in their singular form, e.g. compareAIC not compareAICs.

### Variable Names
* Variables that are used inside functions will be all lower case except where it harms readablity and may be seperated by a period except which this would yield an S3 class-like name.

### Dataset Names
* Root dataset names will be a capital letters.
* Subsets/Modifications of those dataset names will be denoted by a period and then the nature of the modification.

Not all code is in here is mine.  Not all code in here works.

## Style Guide
Suggestions accepted.
### Function Names
* Functions will be provided in camelCaseLikeThis except where it harms readablity or makes no sense.
* For example km2mi is not benefited by being turned into km2Mi.
* Abreviations are all uppercase unless they start the function name.  For example aicCompare versus compareAIC.
* As a general matter, functions will be defined in verb-noun order as in "I want to <verb> <noun>".
* Nouns for these purposes will remain in their singular form, e.g. compareAIC not compareAICs.

### Variable Names
* Variables that are used inside functions will be all lower case except where it harms readablity and may be seperated by a period except which this would yield an S3 class-like name.

### Dataset Names
* Root dataset names will be a capital letters.
* Subsets/Modifications of those dataset names will be denoted by a period and then the nature of the modification.
